# Orth Project Guidelines

## Project Context

Orth is a customized fork of xxl-job under the Abyss project, designed for high-performance Python batch data collection task scheduling and execution.

## Architecture

- **Manager (Orth)**: Java-based scheduling and coordination layer
- **Executor (Python)**: Python-based task execution for data collection
- Emphasis on high concurrency, low latency, and streaming data processing

## Language Preference

- Use English for all code, comments, and documentation
- Gradually phase out existing Chinese content in iterations

## Design Philosophy

- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Apply defensive programming: validate inputs, handle edge cases explicitly
- Write concise, modular code; avoid over-encapsulation
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

## Documentation Requirements

- Add clear comments for distributed locks: acquisition timing, release conditions
- Document state machine transitions: conditions, side effects, failure handling
- Explain retry logic and failure recovery mechanisms
